Develop a Prototype of a Website using Bootstrap 4

![Bootstrap_4](https://github.com/davidgm17/p4_Bootstrap/blob/master/src/resources/img/bootstrap-logo.png)

# Introduction

Develop a prototype for the project you created in [P1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SFCxmT2ibmHUssbJGA79FjifcboCwDBwBzuA37XQJpM/) using Bootstrap 4 in three steps:

1.  Develop a Prototype of your project / improve it according to the correction of P1
    
2.  Create a Style Guide
    
3.  Upload your site to a (free) web server
    

  

Optionally, you can create a different project, but it has to be some kind of online shop and meet all the requirements.

## 1.- Requirements

Create a prototype of the mockup you designed in [P1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SFCxmT2ibmHUssbJGA79FjifcboCwDBwBzuA37XQJpM/)  using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/).

As you surely remember, the pages that you created in your mockup were:

1.  Home Page
    
2.  Page of a category
    
3.  Page of a subcategory
    
4.  Page of a product
    
~~5.  Cookies Policy Page~~
    
~~6.  About Page~~
    
7.  Login/Register Page
    
8.  Shopping Cart Page
    

  

You do not have to implement the pages that have been ~~crossed out~~ !

You have to use at least once in your prototype every one of these graphical elements:

-   [Badges](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_badges.asp) and [Buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_buttons.asp)
    
-   [Carousel](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_carousel.asp) to show the products on promotion or discount
    
-   [Cards](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_cards.asp) to create an element of a list of products
    
-   [Custom Forms](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_forms_custom.asp) to implement filters of the products
    
-   [Forms](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_forms.asp) to create the Login & Registration forms
    
-   [Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_grid_system.asp) to show a list of products and [Pagination](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_pagination.asp)
    
-   [Icons](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/bootstrap_icons_glyphicons.asp) to implement the icons
    
-   Images to implement the images of the lists of products, for instance
    
-   [Modal](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_modal.asp) that shows up when the user hover/clicks on the shopping cart icon in the header. (There should be at least 1 product in the shopping cart).
    
-   [Navbar](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_navbar.asp) to create the menu or menus of your website
    
-   [Tables](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_tables.asp) to lay out the Shopping Cart
    
-   [Typography](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_typography.asp)
    
-   Some kind of Bootstrap [Validation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#validation) of Forms (Required fields, email field, etc.)
    

  

### Extra considerations

-   The menu has to contain the complete set of categories and subcategories
    
-   In the menu, only 1 category will have a real link to the only page of a category you have to implement
    
-   In the submenu, only 1 subcategory of that category will have a real link to the only page of a subcategory you have to implement
    
-   In the lists of products that you create, you only need to show one product. That means that if your list has, for instance, 24 products, the 24 products can be identical and must be linked to the only page of product you need to develop
    
-   The pagination is fake and doesn’t need to be linked (you’re just creating a Prototype after all)
    
-   Remember that you only need to create 1 page of product for your prototype
    
-   Do not use Templates! The purpose of this practice is not to Copy/Paste code. You can exceptionally reuse some components (for instance, a Carousel implementation) if you mention in the document Style_Guide.pdf
    

  

## 2.- Style Guide

Complete the style guide you created in P1.

Since now you’re going to design a prototype, you can specify in your style guide a lot more information about your project. The Style Guide will have a minimum of 6 pages and a maximum of 10 pages.

You have to export your style guide in a file named Style_Guide.pdf

  

## 3.- Deploy your prototype on the web

You don’t need to get a web server, just use Githack or similar to deploy your Github Repo on the web.

Put a link to the deployment of your website in the README.MD file of your Github Repository.

Test that the website of your project works correctly before you hand over the project!

Remember to use [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) in your project to avoid having to upload Bootstrap libraries.

  

# How to hand over this practice

To hand over your project:

1.  Upload your project and your guide style in a private Repository  in Github
    
2.  In the main directory of the Repository, the main file must be named index.html
    
3.  Also upload the Style Guide file Style_Guide.pdf in the main directory of the repo
    
4.  Put a link to the deployment of your web in the README.MD file of your Github Repo
    
5.  VERY IMPORTANT!  Insert in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uZVvtS6AN32pQb6sQe4QAVpP1YUzlkTvQ3khjsKwShI/edit#gid=0) the URL of your Repository
    
6.  VERY IMPORTANT!  Add me as a Collaborator in your Repo (my username is classicoman2 )
    

Here you have a [sample of how the repository has to look like](https://github.com/classicoman2/sample/tree/master) (of course you’ll have to add images and extra files that are not in the sample repository)
